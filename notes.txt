how to creat a website ?
1- creat the web server
built-in HTTP packages are already provided in golang,
we need a web server to accept a GET request and serve a respone,
the make the web server respond to a POST request submitted by a form
2- define handlers
3- connect(import) package ascii-art
4- HTML 

*HTML can be done first step (front to back), above steps back to front

*at some point the data must be sent to the web server, by using javascript or forms... it is recommended 
to use the form to maintain mental and psychological health

Powerpuff coders can do it >:)

*1 -Package template implements data-driven templates for generating textual output.
    we have 2 (input(text), output(converted))

   -Templates are executed by applying them to a data structure (textBanner in our case). 
   Annotations in the template refer to elements of the data structure (typically a field
   of a struct or a key in a map) to control execution and derive values to be displayed. 
   Execution  of the template walks the structure and sets the cursor, represented by a period '.' 
   and called "dot", to the value at the current location in the structure as execution 
   proceeds.
