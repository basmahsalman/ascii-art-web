how to creat a website ?
1- creat the web server
2- define handlers
3- connect(import) package ascii-art
4- HTML 

*HTML can be done first step (front to back), above steps back to front

*at some point the data must be sent to the web server, by using javascript or forms... it is recommended 
to use the form to maintain mental and psychological health

Powerpuff coders can do it >:)
